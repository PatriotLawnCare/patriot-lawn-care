    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p><strong>Veteran Owned. Community Driven. Mission Focused.</strong></p>
    <p>
      Patriot Lawn Care was founded by veterans with a passion for continuing service — this time, in the neighborhoods we call home. After proudly serving our country, we’ve returned with a new mission: to serve our communities with the same integrity, discipline, and attention to detail that defined our time in uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      We employ a team made up primarily of fellow veterans — men and women who bring unmatched work ethic, professionalism, and pride to everything we do. Lawn care is more than a job to us; it's a way to give back, maintain purpose, and build strong roots in the towns we love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our core values — <strong>honor, reliability, respect, and excellence</strong> — aren’t just words to us. They’re the foundation of how we operate. From showing up on time to leaving every lawn better than we found it, we take pride in a job well done.
