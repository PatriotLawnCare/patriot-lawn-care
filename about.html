  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p><strong>Veteran Owned. Community Driven. Mission Focused.</strong></p>
  <p>Patriot Lawn Care was founded by veterans with a passion for continuing service — this time, in the neighborhoods we call home. After proudly serving our country, we’ve returned with a new mission: to serve our communities with the same integrity, discipline, and attention to detail that defined our time in uniform.</p>
  <p>We proudly employ a team made up primarily of fellow veterans — men and women who bring unmatched work ethic, professionalism, and pride to everything we do. For us, lawn care isn’t just a job — it’s a way to give back, stay connected, and maintain purpose.</p>
  <p>Our core values — <strong>honor, reliability, respect, and excellence</strong> — aren’t just words. They’re the foundation of how we do business. From arriving on time to leaving your property spotless, we take pride in every single job. Your lawn is the first impression of your home — and we’re here to make it shine.</p>
  <p>Whether you're a homeowner looking for weekly maintenance or need seasonal cleanup, we’re ready to serve. Because even though our military service has ended, our mission continues.</p>
